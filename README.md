# customers_EDA

This project aims to analyze customer behavior and identify key trends to inform marketing strategies for a retail company.

Data Exploration and Preprocessing

Loading Data: The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame using the pandas.read_csv() function.
Data Cleaning: Missing values are handled by removing rows with missing customer IDs. Outliers in purchase amounts are identified using box plots and removed.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Summary Statistics: Basic summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) are calculated for numerical variables.
Data Visualization: Histograms, bar charts, and scatter plots are used to visualize the distribution of purchase amounts, product categories, and customer purchase frequency.

Tools and Technologies

Python: The primary programming language used for data analysis and visualization.
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis. Â  
NumPy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib: For creating static plots.
scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks (clustering, classification).
gradio: to make a demo
